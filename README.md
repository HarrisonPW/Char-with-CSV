# Introduction:
The Chat with CSV project is a combination of the power of large language models (LLMs) with the need for simple and intuitive data visualization platforms that human can interact with. We used models like ChatGPT and GPT4, along with the API key to achieve this. We aimed to create an environment where users could interactively analyze their data and engage in a conversation using **EvaDB** and **SQLite**, which is a open source database system to support data storage. It is an innovative and easy approach to data analysis that has the potential to revolutionize how users understand and interpret their data.
